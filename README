We have two deamon programs in acceleration_d, which are accelerationd_part2.c specifically for question 2 and  accelerationd.c for the rest. 
In the deamon programs, we poll the sensor data and call system call signal to send the signal data into the kernel to set up acc_motion event.
We write our test program acctest in test directory. In the test program, we first define three acc_motion events for vertical shake, horizontal shake 
and shake. We then write a forkEvent function to fork the process, create acc_motion event and call system calls. The order in the in the forkEvent is : 
define acc_motion event --> call system call create (create acc_motion event and store it in the kernel) -->call system call wait (wait for trigger sample)
-->call system destroy(destroy events that have been triggered). We uses child processes to do all the tasks and let parent to wait for all of them.
In flo-kernel/arch/arm/kernel/acceleration.c, where all our system calls are defined and coded, contains five system calls and a function call. 
All the system calls are designed according to the homework instruction, we list our special design for each one.
1. set_acceleration : just a simple system call for question 2 that recieves signals from deamon
2. accevt_create : Once the test program call create, we pass in the acc_motion event and store in the idr map structure in the kernel and also initialize
		   the wait_queue_head defined in each acc_motion event.
3. accevt_signal : This system call is called by the deamon whenever a new signal is detected and need to pass to the kernel. Once we recieve the signal, we
		   calculate its dlt value and strength with the former signal and store them using KFIFO dltFifo and then copy to windowCopy which is an 
		   acc_dlt (a structure designed for the samples) array with size WINDOW. We then pass the windowCopy to the function idr_for_each which will
		   go through all the acc_motion event we have stored to see if any of them can be triggered. In idr_for_each, we have to use call back 
		   function which is checkMotion_cb to compare through the acc_motion lists and wakeup any events that are triggered. 
4. accevt_wait : After calling accevt_create, the processes then call this system call and start waiting. Once the trigger condition is changed and wakeup 
		 is called by the funciton call checkMotion_cb, we stop waiting.
5. accevt_destroy : Once the process is triggered, the test program call destroy to destroy the acc_motion event in the map in the kernel. In here, we 
		    have a int numProc to record if all the processes waiting for this acc_motion event have been waken. If they did, we then destory the
		    acc_motion event from the list.
